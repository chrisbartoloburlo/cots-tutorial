/**
 * GitLab API
 * An OpenAPI definition for the GitLab REST API. Few API resources or endpoints are currently included. The intent is to expand this to match the entire Markdown documentation of the API: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/>. Contributions are welcome.  When viewing this on gitlab.com, you can test API calls directly from the browser against the `gitlab.com` instance, if you are logged in. The feature uses the current [GitLab session cookie](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/index.html#session-cookie), so each request is made using your account.  Instructions for using this tool can be found in [Interactive API Documentation](openapi_interactive.md). 
 *
 * The version of the OpenAPI document: v4
 * 
 *
 * NOTE: This class is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech).

 * Do not edit the class manually.
